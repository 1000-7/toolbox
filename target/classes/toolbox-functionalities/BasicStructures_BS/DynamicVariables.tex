\subsubsection*{Description}

Dynamic variables define the list of dynamic variables to be used in the dynamic BN models.

\subsubsection*{Detailed functionality}

\begin{itemize}
\item List of objects named allVariables and temporalClones of the type Variable. 

\item A dynamic variable is characterised by its name, ID, the number of states, the state space type, the distribution type, if it is observable or not, and if it is temporal clone or not.

\item The state space type could be either Multinomial or Real.

\item The distribution type could be either Multinomial or Gaussian.

\item The list of observable dynamic variables and their temporal clones is initialised using the list of Attributes (that are already parsed from the dataset or specified by the user), then hidden variables and their temporal clones can be also added.

\end{itemize}
