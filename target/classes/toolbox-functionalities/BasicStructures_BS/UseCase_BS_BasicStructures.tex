\subsubsection*{Description of the Use Case}

This use case will cover the basic data structures to handle the probabilistic graphical models belonging to the AMIDST model class, and to be included in the toolbox (a tentative list is given below).

On the other hand, information about possible models to be plug-in into the toolbox beyond the project is also desirable to be indicated.  

\subsubsection*{Must-Requirements List of the Use Case}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Static Bayesian network (BN)
\item Two-time slice dynamic Bayesian network (2T-DBN)
\item Bounded dynamic Bayesian network 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Should-Requirements List of the Use Case}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Additional operations for learning Bayesian networksS
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Could-Requirements List of the Use Case}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Factor graphs
\end{enumerate}
