This directory contains several library files:

o libhugin.a and libhugin2.a are library archives (static libraries) for
  the C API for Hugin Decision Engine v8.0.

  - libhugin.a uses single-precision floating-point numbers to represent
    discrete probability data

  - libhugin2.a uses double-precision floating-point numbers to represent
    discrete probability data

  [Both versions use double-precision floating-point numbers to represent
  means and (co)variances.]

  To use the single-precision version of the library, link with the
	-L$HUGINHOME/Libraries -lhugin -lz
  options.

  To use the double-precision version of the library, link with the
	-L$HUGINHOME/Libraries -lhugin2 -lz
  options *and* add the
	-DH_DOUBLE
  flag when compiling source files that include the "hugin.h" header file.

  Refer to the "Hugin API Reference Manual" for more information.

o libhugin.dylib and libhugin2.dylib are shared libraries for the C API
  for Hugin Decision Engine v8.0.  The usage instructions are the same
  as for the static libraries.

o libhugincpp.dylib and libhugincpp2.dylib are shared libraries for the
  C++ API for Hugin Decision Engine v8.0.

  - libhugincpp.dylib uses single-precision floating-point numbers to
    represent discrete probability data

  - libhugincpp2.dylib uses double-precision floating-point numbers to
    represent discrete probability data

  [Both versions use double-precision floating-point numbers to represent
  means and (co)variances.]

  To use the single-precision version of the library, link with the
	-L$HUGINHOME/Libraries -lhugincpp
  options.

  To use the double-precision version of the library, link with the
	-L$HUGINHOME/Libraries -lhugincpp2
  options *and* add the
	-DH_DOUBLE
  flag when compiling source files that include the "hugin" header file.

  Refer to the "Hugin C++ API" documentation and the "Hugin API Reference
  Manual" for more information.

o libhapi80-64.jnilib is the native code for the Java API for Hugin Decision
  Engine v8.0.

  Refer to the "Hugin Java API" documentation and the "Hugin API Reference
  Manual" for more information.

All documentation are located in the ../Documentation directory.
