\section{AS -- Task 4.1: Parallelization of structural learning}\label{sec:parallel}



This section will give updates from Task 4.1, with focus on the actual tool-box implementation of parallel PC. We have two sources of information/ideas how to proceed: 
\bit
\item The slideset/poster we discussed some time ago.
\item Hugin people are investigating lines for parallelizing the PC using  multi-thread and relying on the TAN-PGM paper.
\eit

We should also discuss the learning of TAN classifiers (the PGM paper). Anders has suggested to Antonio that we could include the PGM paper here (except maybe the experiments, that could be reported in D5.1).
In this way there would be no rush for having it implemented in the toolbox.

The setup of this section is that we show in practice how the initial procedures described in the design section is to be used.
