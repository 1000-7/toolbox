\section{HL -- Initial results from the other tasks} \label{sec:otherTasks}

\comment{This section will discuss any results or ideas that have been developed in Tasks 4.2, 4.3, 4.4. 
Not much to include, as the tasks only start at December 1st. Antonio proposes to only take in what has come out of the  requirement analysis document.}
