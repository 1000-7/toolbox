\section{Introduction}


\quote{\emph{Task description: In this task we will establish formal procedures for testing and evaluating the
    developed models and algorithms. This includes specification of maximum response-times, output format,
    relevant formalization of loss functions, investigations into what metrics are relevant to use to quantify
    the ability of the AMIDST system, and considerations about what quantitative improvements AMIDST should
    obtain over state of the art.}}


From Helge's slides at the WP 3 kickoff meeting:
\begin{itemize}
\item Massive datasets: find relevant techniques, ensure scalability, etc.
\item Online evaluation of streams: find relevant techniques, ensure scalability, define behavior in changing environment, etc.
\item Significance of results, e.g., considering changing environment vs. ``reproducability'', distribution for test-statistic, significance levels/sizes of test-sets, etc.
\end{itemize}
