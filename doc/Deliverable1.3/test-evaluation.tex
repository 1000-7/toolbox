\section{Test and evaluation methodology}

\emph{Here we should cover general methods for doing test and evaluation of models in a streaming
  context. These methods will subsequently be instantiated in relation to the three use case providers so I
  guess that we should primarily consider the methods that are directly related to the needs of the use case
  providers, but (taking the back ground of one of the reviewers into account) we might probably benefit from
  going a bit beyond the immediate needs and put all this stuff into a broader context ...}


There has already been some work in this context. A quick search with Google produced the following. I haven't
looked at the papers in any great detail, but considering the titles and authors they certainly seems relevant.
