\section{Introduction}

% Motivation: Large data
% Briefly describe the 3 scenarios.
% We are going to resort to BNs, mainly Dynamic BNs because blah blah.
% Introduce structure of the document. 

Data is being generated at a tremendous rate, e.g. with sensors providing continuous measurements of the environments in which they operate. To handle these big data streams, current systems often employ simplistic solution techniques that, e.g., only consider the most recently generated data or only store the data at a much lower frequency than with which it is generated. By doing so potentially valuable data, which could otherwise have contributed to an improved system accuracy, is being ignored. 

Along this document, we analyse 3 particular domains facing extremely large datasets, namely risk prediction in credit operations, real time event detection in oil-well drilling and real time identification and interpretation of maneuvers in traffic. They will serve as a guide to design the general AMIDST model to provide a scalable framework that facilitates efficient analysis and prediction based on big streaming data. It will be designed as a probabilistic graphical model, which will entail several advantages: 1) uncertainty about predictions can be quantified; 2) missing and erroneous data records and observations can be handled using robust techniques based on well-founded principled methods; and 3) the model itself serves as a compact representation of the data, thus reducing the necessity of storing huge volumes of historical data (as the model is continuously updated with new data).


The structure of the document is as follows: Section \ref{section:executiveSummary} presents the executive summary, Section \ref{Section:Preliminaries} includes some of the required concepts and basic structures to make it easier to interpret the AMIDST models, Section \ref{Section:PreliminaryModels} and Section \ref{section:AMIDSTmodelClass} presents and discuses the proposed general AMIDST model class.
