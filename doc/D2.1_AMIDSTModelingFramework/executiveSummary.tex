\section{Executive summary}\label{section:executiveSummary}

This document describes the AMIDST modelling framework which consists of the general AMIDST model class as well as the specification of the model classes of the three use-case providers, namely, Daimler AG, Cajamar, and Verdande Technology AS.

First, the identified preliminary model classes are introduced, for each use-case, based on the requirements analysis (see Deliverable 1.2 \cite{Fer14b}) as well as the preliminary data analysis (including the use of several tools such as sample correlograms, sample partial correlograms, histograms and bivariate contour plots).

Next, the general AMIDST model class is defined such that it ensures three main requirements: 1) it takes all the preliminary model class characteristics into account; 2) it is applicable to any future, potentially similar, use-cases; and 3) it is scalable, supporting both inference and learning from massive data streams.

It is crucial here to note that the current AMIDST modelling framework should be considered as an initial proposal. The proposal might be updated/extended in the future, in order to better meet AMIDST requirements and be adapted based on new domain insights. The final AMIDST modelling framework will be presented in Deliverable 2.2.
