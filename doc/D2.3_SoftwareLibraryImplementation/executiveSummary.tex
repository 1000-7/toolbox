In this deliverable, we provide an extended and more general overview of the software library related to the implementation of the AMIDST modelling framework previously presented in Deliverable 2.1 \cite{Deliverable2.1} and further developed in Deliverable 2.2. 

In particular, we describe the main core components of the implemented framework, including the data structures used to develop the AMIDST models, the data source management functionalities associated with both the learning and inference engines defined in WP3 and WP4, respectively, as well as the interface to existing softwares, such as the HUGIN AMIDST API ensuring the interaction between the AMIDST toolbox and the HUGIN software.
