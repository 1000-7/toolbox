\section{Executive summary}\label{section:executiveSummary}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The aim of this document is to describe the main features of the software library implementation of the AMIDST modelling framework, namely, the data structure and the core components. 

The software library design and the status of the toolbox implementation have been already introduced in Section 4, Deliverable 4.1 \cite{Deliverable4.1}, basically covering AMIDST software learning capabilities. In this deliverable, we provide an update of the status of the toolbox implementation as well as an extended overview of the AMIDST software library.  


%The library is designed to facilitate an easy integration with the inference and learning modules developed in WP3 and WP4, respectively, and to be easily extendable to meet the particular challenges of each of the work packages 7 and 8.

% Describe what the software covers

% ---- full description of data structure 
% ---- core functions
% ---- around 5 pages

% Include examples how the software works/ how to use it
