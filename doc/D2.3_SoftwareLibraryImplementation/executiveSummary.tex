In this deliverable, we provide an extended and more general overview of the software library related to the implementation of the AMIDST modelling framework previously presented in Deliverable 2.1 \cite{Deliverable2.1}. 


%Recall that the software library design has been partially introduced in Section 4, Deliverable 4.1 \cite{Deliverable4.1}, basically covering the AMIDST software learning capabilities. 

In particular, we describe the main core components of the implemented framework, including the data structures used to develop the AMIDST models, the data source management functionalities associated with both learning and inference engines defined in WP3 and WP4, respectively, as well as the HUGIN AMIDST API ensuring the interaction between AMIDST toolbox and HUGIN software.
