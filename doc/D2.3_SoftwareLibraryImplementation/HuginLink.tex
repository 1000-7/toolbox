\section{Hugin link} \label{sec:HuginLink}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This component includes all the functionalities needed to link the AMIDST toolbox with the Hugin software. This connection is primarily ensured by converting Hugin models into AMIDST models, and vice versa. 

This is extremely useful as it allows us for instance to test and assess some of the implemented AMIDST functionalities within a well-stablished platform as Hugin. For instance, a new inference algorithm implemented in AMIDST could be compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms included in Hugin. In addition, the connection with Hugin could be more efficient as it extends and provides some extra functionalities to AMIDST toolbox, such as the use of parallel TAN for structural learning.

\subsection{BN converter from AMIDST to Hugin format} \label{ConverterFromAmidstToHugin}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This functionality addresses the conversion of a Bayesian network from AMIDST to Hugin. This conversion is done at ``object-level'', which is far more efficient that if done by converting the models to data files and, then, parsing them. 

This is brief code fragment showing how to convert a BN from Amidst to Hugin format and stored it on a file. Then, we can open HUGIN and visually inspect the BN created with the AMIDST toolbox. 

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{l} \hline
\texttt{BayesianNetwork amidstBN = BayesianNetwork.newBayesianNetwork(dag);}\\
\texttt{Domain huginNetwork = ConverterToHugin.convertToHugin(amidstBN);}\\
\texttt{huginNetwork.saveAsNet("networks/huginStaticBNHiddenExample.net");}\\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
