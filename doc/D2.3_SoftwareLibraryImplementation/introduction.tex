\section{Introduction}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this deliverable, we present an overview of the software library implementation of the AMIDST toolbox.  

Section \ref{sec:DataStructures} gives a general overview of the core components of the framework, including data structures for variables, graphs, Bayesian networks, dynamic Bayesian networks, key distributions such as multinomial and conditional linear Gaussian distributions represented in both standard form and as exponential families. Section \label{sec:DataBases} provides a description of the considered database functionalities that will be used by AMIDST learning and inference algorithms. Section \ref{sec:HuginLink} presents the functionalities defined for transforming AMIDST models to and from Hugin API.
