	Abstract = {Bayesian belief networks provide a natural, efficient method for representing probabilistic dependen- cies among a set of variables. For these reasons, numerous researchers are exploring the use of belief networks as a knowledge representation m artificial intelligence. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. We show that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms.},

@incollection{TurnerSahani11,
	Abstract = {Variational methods are a key component of the
                  approximate inference and learning toolbox. These
                  methods fill an important middle ground, retaining
                  distributional information about uncertainty in
                  latent variables, unlike maximum a posteriori
                  methods (MAP), and yet generally requiring less
                  computational time than Monte Carlo Markov Chain
                  methods. In particular the variational Expectation
                  Maximisation (vEM) and variational Bayes algorithms,
                  both involving variational optimisation of a
                  free-energy, are widely used in time-series
                  modelling. Here, we investigate the success of vEM
                  in simple probabilistic time-series models. First we
                  consider the inference step of vEM, and show that a
                  consequence of the well-known compactness property
                  of variational inference is a failure to propagate
                  uncertainty in time, thus limiting the usefulness of
                  the retained distributional information. In
                  particular, the uncertainty may appear to be
                  smallest precisely when the approximation is
                  poorest. Second, we consider parameter learning and
                  analytically reveal systematic biases in the
                  parameters found by vEM. Surprisingly, simpler
                  variational approximations (such a mean-field) can
                  lead to less bias than more complicated structured
                  approximations.  },
