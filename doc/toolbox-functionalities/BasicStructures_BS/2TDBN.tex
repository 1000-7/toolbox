\subsubsection*{Description}

This functionality is similar to the one defined for Bayesian network (see \ref{BNs:ID}), but it aims here to represent instead a two slice-time dynamic Bayesian network (2T-DBN). It handles its structure (dynamic DAG defined over a set of dynamic variables) and the set of its distributions at time 0 and time T. 

\subsubsection*{Detailed functionality}

\begin{itemize}

\item The distributions of each dynamic variable at both time 0 and time T are initialised and specified according to the variable type and the type of its potentiel parent set. 

\item After this step, the set of parents of each dynamic variable becomes unmodifiable.

\end{itemize}
