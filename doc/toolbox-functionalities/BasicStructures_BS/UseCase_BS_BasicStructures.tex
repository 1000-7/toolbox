\subsubsection*{Description of the Use Case}

This use case will cover the basic data structures to handle the probabilistic graphical models belonging to the AMIDST model class, and to be included in the toolbox (a tentative list is given below).

On the other hand, information about possible models to be plug-in into the toolbox beyond the project is also desirable to be indicated.  

%It is important to specify the following characteristics for each proposed model:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Which distributions will be modelled: multinomials, Gaussians, logistics, MoTBFs?
%\item In which models the use of exponential family distributions is required/sufficient?
%\item Is it required to use parallel/distributed-computation techniques to store the models  (structures and potentials).  
%\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Must-Requirements List of the Use Case}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Static Bayesian networks
\item Two-time slice dynamic Bayesian networks
\item Bounded dynamic Bayesian networks
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Should-Requirements List of the Use Case}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Additional operations for learning Bayesian networks
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Could-Requirements List of the Use Case}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Factor graphs
\end{enumerate}
