\subsubsection*{Description}

This class defines a static Bayesian network using the already specified graphical structure (DAG) along with the conditional probability distribution of each variable given the set of its parents.  

\subsubsection*{Detailed functionality}

\begin{itemize}

\item The distribution of each variable in the Bayesian network is initialised and specified according to its type and the type of its potentiel parent set. 

\item After this step, the set of parents of each variable becomes unmodifiable.

\end{itemize}
