\subsubsection*{Description}

Attributes serve as an intermediary to build the Static or Dynamic Variables from the dataset that are parsed from the dataset and/or specified by the user (precisely by a class that extends this class). 

\subsubsection*{Detailed functionality}

\begin{itemize}
\item List of objects of the type Attribute. This list becomes Unmodifiable after construction.
\item There can be two special attributes, namely "TIME\_ID" AND "SEQUENCE\_ID". The former refers to a temporal identifier whereas the second identifies a particular sequence (e.g. a client in CajaMar or a drill in Verdande). They only exist if they explicitly appear in the dataset with that particular names.
\end{itemize}
