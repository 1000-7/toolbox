\subsubsection*{Description}

DataInstance is an interface that can be implemented by a StaticDataInstance and a DynamicDataInstance. The former stores one row (DataRow) of the dataset at a time, whereas the second contains two rows of the dataset. 

\subsubsection*{Detailed functionality}

A DynamicDataInstance always has a TimeID and a SequenceID. If this two attributes, or any of the two, are not in the dataset then they are automatically filled in, incrementally for the TimeID and with a value of $1$ for the SequenceID.

\begin{itemize}
\item StaticDataInstance: contains one DataRow
\item DynamicDataInstance: contains a past and a present DataRow, a TimeID and a SequenceID. The TimeID attribute in the dataset can be used to represent missing samples (stored as DataRowMissing), in which all attribute values are NaN.
\end{itemize}
