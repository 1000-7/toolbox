\subsubsection*{Description}

This functionality addresses the representation of the probability distributions in an exponential family form. I.e. they are encoded by a vector of natural and moment parameters. Functionality for computing the sufficient statistics for a data instance is also provided. These set of classes are going to be used across several use cases:  ML, VMP, EP, VMAP, etc. 

\subsubsection*{Detailed functionality}

The type of each variable and its parents determine the different exponential family distributions detailed next:

\begin{itemize}
\item Multinomial variable with no parents
\item Multinomial variable with multinomial parents.
\item Gaussian variable with no parents.
\item Gaussian variable with multinomial parents.
\item Gaussian variable with Gaussian parents. 
\item Gaussian variable with multinomial and Gaussian parents. 

\end{itemize}
