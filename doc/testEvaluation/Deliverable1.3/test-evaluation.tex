\section{Test and evaluation methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

As discussed in the introduction, finding appropriate performance measures on streaming data is more difficult than finding performance measures on static data.  We will therefore start the discussion on discussing some relevant performance measures on static data.  A brief section of state of the art methods on streaming data is included is also included before a justification of our approach is exposed.

%\emph{Here we should cover general methods for doing test and evaluation of models in a streaming
%  context. These methods will subsequently be instantiated in relation to the three use case providers so I
%  guess that we should primarily consider the methods that are directly related to the needs of the use case
%  providers, but (taking the back ground of one of the reviewers into account) we might probably benefit from
%  going a bit beyond the immediate needs and put all this stuff into a broader context ...}
