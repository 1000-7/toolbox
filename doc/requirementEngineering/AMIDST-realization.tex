\section{Realization of the requirements engineering process}
\label{sec:realization}

This part of the report is written in month six when most of the process is conducted.  This section contains a few points on what experiences we have gained in the project so far:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Everyone involved has had a learning experience on many levels.  The industrial partners have learned about probabilistic graphical models, while the academic partners have learned about the industrial domains.  Most participants have increased their knowledge on how to conduct a requirement analysis. 
\item There has only been one meeting where all stakeholders have met, which was the kickoff meeting in Denmark in month three.  Most communication has been done through Skype and email, but also a few face to face meetings have taken place. Most of the communications have been related to clarifications in terms of filling out the template X1.
\item There have been adjustments of the template X1 as the process has proceeded.  Examples of this is adding fields to the requirements so they could be linked to concrete tasks in the AMIDST project or adding columns for rating the importance of a requirement.
\end{enumerate}
