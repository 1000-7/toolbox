\section{Conclusion, observations and reflections}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Based on the lack of agreement in literature and in practice on a unified RE process for small projects, we chose to make our own process.  The approach was to identify the main characteristics in the AMIDST project that is believed to have an impact on the choices for how to conduct the RE process.  The main characteristics are that there is a pre-specified scope in the project, many different stakeholders, the software is supposed to solve very different problems and that the targets are not fully defined.  A use-case driven approach was chosen and we also introduced a document template early in the project to mitigate the above challenges.  The project is not finished yet, so it is difficult to fully evaluate the process today.  However, it is positive that there seem to be a high level of agreement between the partners at this point.
