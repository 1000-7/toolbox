\section{Introduction}

The requirements engineering (RE) process adopted by a particular software project typically reflects intrinsic
characteristics of the project in question. Thus, there is often no standard way to conduct a RE process \cite{Poh10},
but one rather adapts existing processes to the needs and specifics of the project. This especially applies to smaller
software projects \cite{Qui10,Ara07}, where the RE processes follow
more ad-hoc strategies and a best practice seems to be lacking. 

In this paper, the RE process for the project entitled \emph{Analysis of MassIve Data STreams} (AMIDST) is outlined. AMIDST is a
project that is partially funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological
development and demonstration, and falls in the category of a small development project. AMIDST has a pre-specified
scope, because the grant agreement asserts that the result of the RE process must be in compliance with the \emph{Description
  of Work} (DoW). The DoW defines the scope of the project as well as more general requirements to the system, both
functional and non-functional, and e.g.\ includes a fixed deadline for the RE process. The latter restricts the project from,
e.g., following a strict agile approach \cite{Din10},  where a product owner is continuously renegotiating the
requirements and where the RE process is seen as a continuous process throughout the whole project
\cite{Kav11}. Furthermore, the software framework developed in the project should be sufficiently general to accommodate
stakeholders and use case providers representing different industries. Thus, the RE process relates not only to the software framework, but also to the solutions to be developed
for the use cases of the project. Specifically, for each use case provider the general AMIDST framework will be instantiated in order
to meet the needs and requirements of that use case provider. 

To the best of our knowledge, there exist no guidelines for the RE process for small projects with these
characteristics. This paper therefore  attempts to make a first step towards defining a best practice for such
situations. The project's characteristics and challenges have formed the basis for the development of the AMIDST RE
process. Based primarily on organizational characteristics of the project, the RE process is composed of selected
components from existing RE processes that have been tailored to the identified AMIDST characteristics. However, we
believe that the characteristics are sufficiently general to make them applicable for other small projects. In particular, it is expected that projects that share at least some of the characteristics of the AMIDST project may draw on the methodology that is outlined in this paper.

The paper is outlined as follows. In section  \ref{sec:stateOfArt}, the basic principles of requirement engineering are briefly outlined. Section  \ref{sec:AmidstRequirementProcess} starts by describing the main characteristics of the AMIDST project, before the RE process is presented. In section  \ref{sec:realization}, we have described the realization of the process, and the report is concluded in section  \ref{sec:conclusion}.
