This paper describes the requirements engineering process developed for the EU-funded project AMIDST (Analysis of MassIve DataSTreams). The process adopts a use case based approach to requirements engineering (RE), that is tailored to the specific characteristics of the AMIDST project. These characteristics include a relatively small group of developers, a pre-defined project scope, stakeholders from different industries, and the development of a general software framework that can be instantiated according to the needs of the stakeholders. The resulting methodology is sufficiently general to be of relevance for similar development projects.
